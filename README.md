# ADHD Prediction using 2020 National Survey of Children’s Health
### Background
The NSCH is a national survey funded and directed by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB) that provides rich data on multiple, intersecting aspects of children’s health and well-being – including physical and mental health, access to and quality of health care, and the child’s family, neighborhood, school, and social context.

### The Data
The [dataset](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch.html) from NSCH website. I cleaned and wrangled the data in preparation for building my model. The code for this step is contained in the Notebooks (https://github.com/MaryamNzr/Logistic_Regression_National-Survey-of-Children-Health/blob/main/Pre-processing%20and%20Modeling_2020%20National%20Survey%20of%20Children%E2%80%99s%20Health%20(NSCH)-Mental%2C%20emotional%2C%20developmental%20or%20behavioral%20problems.ipynb).
